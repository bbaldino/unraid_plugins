unraid_plugins
==============
This plugin is still in the very early stages of development!  I'd highly recommend you experiment on a test unraid 
server and/or a test music collection!

The plugin's port isn't configurable yet, as of right now it runs on port 9090

Google authorization is done on the plugin's webserver itself.  It'll give you a URL you can go to and authorize your
 Google account.  Adding and removing of watched paths is done on the plugin's 'config' page.
