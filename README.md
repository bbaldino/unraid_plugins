unraid_plugins
==============

Google Music Uploader
=====================

This plugin is still in the very early stages of development!  I'd highly recommend you experiment on a test unraid 
server and/or a test music collection!

The plugin's port isn't configurable yet, as of right now it runs on port 9090

Google authorization is done on the plugin's webserver itself.  It'll give you a URL you can go to and authorize your
 Google account.  Adding and removing of watched paths is done on the plugin's 'config' page.


Dev Plugins
===========

These are some plugins I've written mainly to make my own development easier, so they're specific to me.  If people want 
I could make them more generic and configurable.

VIM
===

Pretty self explanatory.  Installs my .vimrc by default.

GIT
===

Installs git.  Defaults to my name and login info.
